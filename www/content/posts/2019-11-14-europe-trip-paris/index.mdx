Paris, 24 Oct 2019

2 days are too short to visit Paris. It has so many things to see and do there.
e whole city from the top. We didn’t go inside Louvre, the largest museum in the world. My friend said that if we want to visit the whole museum, 3 months are quired. We didn’t go to the Palace of Versailles, one of the most beautiful palaces in the world.

And a hundred of other museums.

Then we have reasons to come back to Paris.

But where did we go in Paris?

We started the journey in Paris with a walking tour by ourselves along the Seine river. We walked from Sainte Chapelle to Louvre. In our eyes, Paris is so spectacle and imposing, with so many old buildings. Yellow-green leaves cover on yellow pastel building like a thin silk cover the city, makes Paris softer.

The next day, we visited Acr de Triomph in the early morning, around 8:30 pm. We went there early to avoid crowded tourist. But some people came before us, checked in in the front of the giant gate on the Champs-Élyséesavenue. The funny thing is that most of them are Vietnamese. We wait for a while to have more space to take some photos with the giant gate.

People said that Champs-Élysées is the richest area of Paris. If you look on the map, Champs-Élysées avenue is a straight line. If Acr de Triomph is a point of Paris, drawing one line across this point from north to south, you will have Champs-Élysées avenue. And if you draw other lines cross that point, you dawn the map of Paris.

From there, we took a bus to see mademoiselle Eiffel tower. When coming close to the Eiffel, she was not as tall as I imagine.

Hm, what to say about this lady? There were already so many articles about here, I don’t want to create another existing article about her. MY words are just less interesting than the others.

We wanted to come closer to say something to here. But might be she wouldn’t hear us, she a haughty woman. But I don’t care, we came to say one thing, not for her, but for us: Hey, I’m here! Bye bye!
