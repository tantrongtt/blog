22 Oct 2019, train to Paris - Travel or not, it’s just a choice and life is a collection of choice.

Good bye Belgium, the second country of the journey, we are coming to Paris, France.

The autumn green field covers the whole Europe: young green tree, fresh grass, yellow leaf. Autumn is the most beautiful season of the year, at least for me. And it will be more beautiful if we just have a little bit of sunshine.

Beautiful lands are waiting for us. In the past, it was my dream. Coming to France is my purpose or learning French. But it didn’t work out. But today, we are here, under the Eiffel tower and yell to her: “Hey, I came” by my self, not thanks to scholarships :) 

Yes, traveling costs money. We need money to travel. Other people think that if you can travel, you’re rich. For me, it’s just the choice.

You have lots of money, but you can’t stop your work, your daily responsibilities, you will stay at home.

Or when you don’t have much money, you choose to save for the future.
In both cases, you can choose to go to new places, to see how big the world is, to learn about the amazing architecture, technologies, to know that other people are also very nice, polite, not only Vietnamese people.

Like Passenger said in his song:

> “Only hate the road when you’re missing home”  

or Tiên tiên with her popular songs with Soobin Hoàng Sơn:

> “Đi thật xa để thèm được về nhà”  

Travel or not, it’s just a choice and life is a collection of choice.
